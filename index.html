<kbd>one of the closest masjids is this one</kbd>
  <h4 class="text-success">Ranchlands NW masjid</h4>
  <p class="text-muted text-capitalize">This is one of the closest masjids to marion carson school. this masjid is rated 4.5 stars (That's what it says in google). But in my opinion it is 5 stars there's both gender praying rooms which is the good part. There's also a little shop very close to the masjid it is called indian aroma and you can buy stuff there (everything is halal because the owner of the shop is muslim). You can buy flavoured milk gummy bears and meat too. </p>

<kbd>School library (By the way this not the whole library but this is the closest I could find)</kbd>
 <h4 class="text-success">school library</h4>
 <p class="text-muted text-capitalize">You can find a lot of cool and instersting books but it's had to find good books but there are some like amulet and the last firehawk and if you are a fan of cartoonic books you might like geronimo stilton books. </p>

<p>It is fun but it is like 10-15 minutes of playing and if your very early you have to wait until you can play. And the teams aren't fair everyone takes the best players and the other team doesn't have good players. And if you come late you can't play. But good thing you have fun! You learn other players weaknesses and strenths and you know how to get the ball from other players (becuae you know their weakness). And you can improve yourself in soccer and you know how to talk to each other!</p>

<p>Now why I like this better than soccer because I find this more fun and instersting. And because we are learning a new instrument called the recorder it is type of a flute but it is not a flute but it does come in the woodwind instrument familly which means it's a instrument you have to blow into to make a sound!</p>

<p>Now this is what we do in the last ten days of school we do things on the list like 3 days have past and in the first day we watched a movie. In the second day we played Ipads. third day we had show and tell day where you bring something tell about it and show it. Fun fact: before the ten days of school left the teacher said to give her options to do in the last ten days of school and I said ice cream party and the teacher chose it! (actually we are doing a popsicle party but popsicles and ice creams are basically the same.).</p>

<p>Our new teacher is Mrs. Schofield! (She came in 2022 October 31st but she's the newest teacher in our class) Mrs. Schofield is sometimes funny and she's always trying her best! She's really kind,funny,good teaching,and always trying to get us to the green zone(AKA A peace behavior or freshing your mind). we have literacy centers(AKA centers of reading and writing (EXAMPLE: I am in read-to-self group I read a book then for 15-20 mins)) And when I am with her reading group we read a book turn by trun and she's in fun mode at that time(meaning she would read but make a reading sound that everyone likes) which is really fun when she's in the fun mode!</p>
